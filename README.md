# Logicle: A Wordle-style Logical Puzzle Game

Logicle is a web-based game where players guess logical statements using quantifiers, sets, and numbers. 
Inspired by Wordle, it provides an engaging way to practice logical reasoning and mathematical syntax.

## How to Play

- Enter a statement using the on-screen keyboard or your physical keyboard.
- The first few cells represent the quantifier, variable, and set.
- The last cells form a comparison using a number or variable and an operator.
- Green tiles indicate correct symbols in the correct position.
- Gray tiles indicate incorrect symbols.
